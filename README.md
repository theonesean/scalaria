# scalaria: a free, decentralized poker cardroom

**Scalaria** (Latin for ladder) is an open-source, online, browser-based poker website. Anyone can start a new game and invite their friends to play online with them; scalaria uses a decentralized protocol to connect players directly with no central servers. Choose from five-card draw or Texas hold 'em, set your own house rules, and TKTTKTKTK.
