# scalaria: a free, decentralized poker cardroom

**Scalaria** (Latin for ladder) is an open-source, online, browser-based poker website. Anyone can start a new game and invite their friends to play online with them; scalaria uses a decentralized protocol to connect players directly with no central servers. Choose from five-card draw or Texas hold 'em, set your own house rules, and play as much as you want.

## Playing

Eventually, you'll be able to host your own poker games with this app. That'll be live at [scalaria.horrific.dev](https://scalaria.horrific.dev).

You're also welcome to self-host this app. 

## Building

This app was boostrapped with `create-cljs-app`, and thusly uses npm tooling. You can build it with `npm run build` or start a live server with `npm start`, which will host the app in dev mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Contributing

It'd be awesome if you want to contribute to this project! I am a student making this in my spare time. If you have the inclination, please feel free to contribute by:

* testing the app (especially versions that haven't been released yet) and reporting bugs, weird behaviors, or bad design
* helping to optimize the app's design for smaller screens, less common browers, and mobile devices
* opening issues for new features, bugs, enhancements, or anything else
* contributing to already-open issues by trying to replicate bug reports and participating in discussion
* improving the codebase and submitting pull requests
